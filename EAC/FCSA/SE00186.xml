<biogHist>
<abstract>Farr Cottage was the new name given to Fuller Street Cottage at Walkerville in 1982. Run by the Anglican Church it was one of the Cottage Homes on the site of Kennion House. It was run as a separate group home. In 1986 Farr Cottage moved to Nailsworth. It took over some programs from Rose Cottage in Prospect in 1993 and by 1994 it was accommodating children with special needs. Farr Cottage is thought to have closed around 1996.</abstract>
<p>During the 1970s and 1980s the government encouraged non-government care providers to move away from large institutions and develop smaller group residential care for children in need. After the passing of the Community Welfare Act in 1972, non-government agencies were required to sign agreements with the government and to adhere to standards of residential care.</p>
<p>Farr Cottage was the new name given to Fuller Street Cottage at Fuller Street, Walkerville, in 1982. It was run by the Anglican Church of Australia as a separate group home. The Cottage was one of several on the site of Kennion House that were originally developed in the mid to late 1970s when Kennion House was restructured to provide Cottage style care.</p>
<p>In 1986 Farr Cottage moved to First Avenue, Nailsworth. From 1993 some children were placed at Farr Cottage because they had been assessed as being unsuitable for foster placements and were involved in a therapeutic program with their families, which was aimed at reunification. This program had previously been run at Rose Cottage in Prospect.</p>
<p>By 1994 it was accommodating children with special needs. Farr Cottage is thought to have closed in 1996.</p>
