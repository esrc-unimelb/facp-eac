<biogHist>
<abstract>Windana Remand Home opened within the grounds of the Glandore Boys' Home in 1965. Run by the government it provided a secure institution for children on remand. It also provided temporary accommodation for State children being transferred between institutions or to foster care, replacing the Central Depot. It catered for children between 2 and 18 years of age and could accommodate 108 children. In 1972 it became a remand centre for boys only. Windana closed in 1975.</abstract>
<p>Windana , an Aboriginal word meaning 'which way', was a remand home which opened in 1965 within the grounds of the Glandore Boys' Home. It was run by the government and catered for both 'neglected' and 'delinquent' children. It was specifically developed to provide a secure institution for children on remand awaiting their appearance before the Juvenile Court and to receive children arrested by the Police. Some boys from Bedford Park Boys' Training Centre were sent to Windana when Bedford Park closed.</p>
<p>Windana also provided temporary accommodation and residential assessment for State children who were being transferred between institutions, or in and out of foster care. It took over this role from the Central Depot when it closed in 1965. Occasionally non-state children were housed at Windana for 'safe-keeping'. The age range of children in the centre was from 2 to 18.</p>
<p>The institution could accommodate up to 108 children within four separate sections. Most children remained for a period of up to three weeks. During that time the children's care and accommodation needs were assessed before they were transferred on to another institution or into other forms of care. A school, run by a teacher from the Education Department, operated within the home. Organised recreation, such as sport, craftwork and hobbies, was also provided. Visiting clergy provided religious instruction. Parents and relatives were allowed to visit with permission from the Department.</p>
<p>Usually within 72 hours of being admitted to Windana, Children were interviewed by a senior officer and a social worker. They were also examined by a medical officer.</p>
<p>Overcrowding in the separate sections of Windana created problems at the institution. The section designated for 'delinquent' boys was often full which meant many younger children had to be accommodated in the area set aside for 'neglected' boys. This problem was noted in a 1966 Annual Report along with the fact that boys often stayed at Windana for longer than 3 weeks. During 1968-1969 the home was extended to provide more space for juvenile male offenders. However, this did not solve the problem and Windana continued to be overcrowded.</p>
<p>In 1972, partly as a result of the new Community Welfare Act of that year and partly because of overcrowding, Windana became a remand and residential assessment centre for boys only. Girls on remand were sent to Vaughan House for assessment and neglected girls were cared for in the Glandore Family Home, a part of the Glandore Boys' Home.</p>
<p>Windana continued to operate until June 1975 when the changes to assessment procedures speeded up the process, reducing the time boys spent in remand. Once Windana closed, the Residential Assessment process took place at Brookway Park and the McNally Training Centre.</p>
<p>Windana Remand Home was one of the institutions that came under scrutiny for allegations of abuse during the Children in State Care Inquiry 2004-2008.</p>
