<biogHist>
<abstract>Disability Services holds a collection of client records from The Home for Incurables and its successors and from institutions run by the Intellectually Disabled Services Council, including the Strathmont Centre and Ru Rua Nursing Home. These records include client registers and files. The records may also contain information related to other private disability services such as Minda Home</abstract>
<h4>Access Conditions</h4>
<p>To enquire about applying for access to records held by Disability Services, contact the Freedom of Information Officer for Disabilities Services who is located at Highgate Park. Records held by Disability Services include names and personal information related to individual clients. For this reason, you will need to complete a Freedom of Information application form.</p>
<p>Once an application is received, all records which might relate to the inquiry will be checked for information and the relevant information collated. If files also include records relating to a private organisation, such as Minda Home, Disability Services will consult with the related organisation before releasing documents produced by them.</p>
<h4>Records</h4>
<p>Disability Services holds client records from The Home for Incurables and its successors, from the Strathmont Centre and Ru Rua Nursing Home. These include the following:</p>
<list><item>Client Registers for the Home for Incurables. Registers list the following information on each resident (1) date of birth, (2) malady, (3) the date of residence, (4) religion and (5) next of kin information. </item>
<item>Client files for the Strathmont Centre. These detailed client files provide more information. These files remain current as long as clients are resident at the Centre. </item>
<item>Client files for Ru Rua Nursing Home.</item>
<item>Client files often contain notes or assessments dating from a client's first contact with a disability service. In the past when services merged or were replaced, the files and/or information from files were often combined. For this reason information from different services, such as Minda Home, may appear on a client file. Before the State Records Act was passed, when services merged or if a client passed away some files were destroyed. </item></list>
