<h4>Access Conditions</h4>
<p>Former residents of the children's Homes of the Anglican Diocese of Adelaide and Church of England, or members of their families, can apply to the Diocesan Archivist to be provided with information and/or copies of records relevant to their time in care. Physical access to the historical records of the children's Homes or the church's Social Welfare Bureau is not permitted due to the fragility of the material and the need to protect the privacy of third parties.</p>
<h4>Records</h4>
<p>Record keeping practices varied significantly from one Home to another and from one time period to another, with respect to the quantity and types of records that were created and preserved. Many of the following records are fragmentary or incomplete, or were created only for specific time periods during the overall duration of the Homes.</p>
<p>Farr House Records include committee minutes, correspondence and working papers; financial records; working records of the home such as weekend books, staff entries book, a day book; shopping and provisioning records; staff records including employment and wages information; social workers' reports and correspondence; subsidy claims records; reports of the chairman of the board; reports to the review board; referral and admission sheets; correspondence with the Minister of Community Welfare; review board reports; resident notes; building and architectural records. The collection also includes a small group of historical research and study notes.</p>
