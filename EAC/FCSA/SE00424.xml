<biogHist>
<abstract>St Mary's Mission of Hope Records is a collection of records created between 1903-1990 by staff and officers of St Mary's Home for Children and St Mary's Mission of Hope. The records include committee minutes; matrons' reports; visitors' reports; secretary's reports; financial records; correspondence and working papers of the committee; building and architectural records; annual reports; and admission files.</abstract>
<h4>Access Conditions</h4>
<p>Former residents of the children's Homes of the Anglican Diocese of Adelaide and Church of England, or members of their families, can apply to the Diocesan Archivist to be provided with information and/or copies of records relevant to their time in care. Physical access to the historical records of the children's Homes or the church's Social Welfare Bureau is not permitted due to the fragility of the material and the need to protect the privacy of third parties.</p>
<h4>Records</h4>
<p>Record keeping practices varied significantly from one Home to another and from one time period to another, with respect to the quantity and types of records that were created and preserved. Many of the following records are fragmentary or incomplete, or were created only for specific time periods during the overall duration of the Homes.</p>
<p>St Mary's Mission of Hope Records include: committee minutes; matrons' reports; visitors' reports; secretary's reports; financial records; correspondence and working papers of the committee; building and architectural records; annual reports; and admission files. The collection also includes a small amount of historical research and study notes.</p>
<p>Records in this collection were listed and indexed as part of the Records Access Documentation Grants in 2017.</p>
