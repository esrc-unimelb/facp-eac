<biogHist>
<abstract>Cavan Training Centre was opened by the government in 1993 at Cavan as a purpose built secure care facility for young men aged between 15 and 18. It accommodated young offenders previously held at the South Australian Youth Training Centre which was renamed the Magill Training Centre. Cavan changed its name to the Adelaide Youth Training Centre when it became part of that new facility in 2012.</abstract>
<p>During the 1990s there was an increase in the number of young people placed on detention orders at the South Australian Youth Training Centre (SAYTC) at Magill. As a result of this, the government decided to build a new facility to separate younger and older children. During 1991-93 a new 36 bed secure care centre was designed and built at 1 Jonal Drive, Cavan.</p>
<p>The Cavan Training Centre opened in September 1993 and young men aged between 15 and 18 were moved there from SAYTC. At that time SAYTC was renamed the Magill Training Centre and it was set aside initially for younger boys. When the South Australian Youth Remand and Assessment Centre (SAYRAC) closed in 1993, some young men were moved to Cavan. The girls were moved to Magill and accommodated in a separate facility for young women.</p>
<p>During the 2000s the Cavan Training Centre operated as a secure custody centre for young men aged between 15 and 18 who were on remand or detention orders. In 2012 the Cavan building became part of a new facility known as the Adelaide Youth Training Centre.</p>
