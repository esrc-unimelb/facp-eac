<biogHist>
<abstract>Werribee (also known as Werribee Girls' Cottage) in Victoria Park was established by the Methodist Homes for Children in Victoria Park in 1962, and run by agencies of the Uniting Church after 1977. It accommodated girls of high school age in a detached house setting on the Jarrah Road boundary of the Mofflyn campus. Girls who were wards of the State were admitted, along with children admitted privately (by family or others). Werribee closed in 1985.</abstract>
<p>Government reports (<span style="font-style:italic">Signposts</span> 2004, pp.565-567) show that Werribee in Victoria Park (also known as Werribee Girls' Cottage) was a group home with live-in house 'parents'. In 1969, the girls at Werribee include four girls who were wards of the State. By 1975, there were nine girls aged 12-15 years who were housed at Werribee on a short term basis The Department of Child Welfare's 'Submission to the Committee of Enquiry into Residential Child Care' in July 1976 (quoted in <span style="font-style:italic">Signposts</span> p.566) described Werribee, which: 'had a garden, play area, trampoline, access to an oval, tennis court, bikes and a range of sporting equipment. There were 3 bedrooms which would sleep three or more girls per room; a study; 2 bathrooms and 2 toilets; and a storeroom; a pool or table tennis table; a TV, piano, and radio or radiogram were available. Girls walked to school. The average length of stay was 9 months. Holiday placements were actively sought for the children. Recreational activities included camping trips.'</p>
<p>Werribee closed in 1985.</p>

There is an article about how some children came into care and also news about how some of the Homes are funded. There is some specific information about Terrace House, Sister Kate Clutterbuck and the Mogumber Training Centre. The newsletter appeals for funds, explains how previous support has helped, and lets readers know what more they can do.</abstract>
