<biogHist>
<abstract>The Department of Native Welfare (and predecessors) Client Files comprise 'case records' about children and families who had come into contact with the Department between 1921 and 1969, when it was responsible for the 'care and protection' of indigenous children. The records include information about births and deaths, as well as about marriages, which had to be approved by the Protector. As a permit was required for employing an Aboriginal person, records were kept on employment and finances. The Department sometimes paid the medical expenses of Aboriginal people when treated by a doctor. Police inspected the communities regularly and a census of those present was taken. Information differs from person to person, as with most records from the past. But the fact that Aboriginal Western Australian's lives were so controlled by government does mean that quite a lot of information has been kept.</abstract>
<h4>Access Conditions</h4>
<p>Access to these records is restricted and confidentiality is protected by Child Protection and Family Support (CPFS). If you believe the Department may hold records about you, or about a family member, you are encouraged to apply. Access is governed by the Freedom of Information Act 1992 and CPFS has a form on their website which you must use to apply for records.</p>
<h4>Records</h4>
<p>In 1972, the 'care and protection' of Indigenous children in Western Australia passed from the Department of Native Welfare to the new Department for Community Welfare, which had previously been the Child Welfare Department. These records were transferred to the Department for Community Welfare and in 2013, these records are held by the Department for Child Protection and Family Support.</p>
<p>Earlier files are held at the State Records Office (Perth), listed under Aboriginal Affairs Department. Some Native Welfare files were converted to Community Welfare files and will be included in the general case files of what is now Child Protection and Family Support.</p>
