<biogHist>
<abstract>Subsidised institution (or scheduled institution) is a term that has been used in Western Australia to describe an institution which received a government inmate subsidy for eligible children accommodated there. At various times, a list of these subsidised institutions would be attached as a schedule to child welfare legislation.</abstract>
<p>Western Australia did not and does not have provision for licensing institutions which had the care of children over the age of three (and, from 1919, six years). The names of institutions which would receive a subsidy from the government (subsidised or scheduled institutions) were listed in child welfare legislation (usually in the Second Schedule), but the names were descriptive rather than legal/formal (except sometimes where the Institution/Home was an incorporated body). The names in the schedules are frequently not identical to the name used in the annual reports of the department responsible for child welfare. The Second Schedule (and institution names) were sometimes updated when there were other amendments to the Act. However, the fact that an amendment to an Act was made without updating the names in the Second Schedule should not be confirmation that an institution did not change its name during the break between Second Schedule updates. Regardless of the name used, the institutions were subsidised by the State and subject to the protections and responsibilities of the Act. The latest legislation to follow this practice was the Child Welfare Act Amendment Act 1976 (No 2).</p>
<p>To 1970, the only government Home that was named in Second Schedules was the main Reception Home at Mt Lawley. The Reception Home at Bridgewater was not added to the schedule after it opened in 1969. Possibly, as they ran their own Homes, the government didn't have to subsidise them as the appropriations came from the departmental budget.</p>
<h4>Second Schedules 1907-1976</h4>
<h4> State Children Act 1907</h4>
<p>Section 15 of the State Children Act 1907: '(1) The Government Industrial School at Subiaco, established before the commencement of this Act, is hereby declared to be a Government institution within the meaning and for the purposes of this Act.
