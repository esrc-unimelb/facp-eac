<abstract>'Salvation Army Nedlands drawings and plans' is a digital copy of five images held in the Salvation Army Children's Homes, Nedlands Library Pictorial Collection. The item shows pencil drawings, apparently from memory by an unknown person, of the buildings and layout of the Salvation Army Boys' Home and Hollywood Children's Village. It shows the bonfire site (1956) and the female officers' quarters. From 1965 smaller cottages were built at the Village, and these are not shown in the drawings.</abstract>

<abstract>'Girls' bedroom' is a digital copy of an undated photograph held in the <span style="font-style:italic">Nedlands Boys Home closed social work</span> file at the Salvation Army Heritage Museum WA. The toys suggest the room was set up for primary school-aged girls so it is likely to have been a new room in a girls' cottage, possibly at the Hollywood Children's Village. The 'candlewick' bedspread and blondewood wardrobe were popular in 1960s Perth. There appears to be another bed visible in the reflection of the wardrobe mirror.</abstract>

<abstract>'Hollywood Children's Village, aerial view' is a a digital copy of an undated photocopy held in the <span style="font-style:italic">Nedlands Boys Home closed social work</span> file at the Salvation Army Heritage Museum WA. A typed list in the file identifies the numbered buildings that are visible on the photocopy, showing the different eras of the property. The list has a note that alerts readers to possible omissions and mis-identification of buildings.

On the right of the photocopy is the site of the original Karrakatta Prison Gate Farm which became the Salvation Army Boys' Home (1 and 2).

On the left, are the newer cottages of the Hollywood Children's Village: Pied Piper Cottage (13); Brand Cottage (14); Buckingham Cottage (15); Cottesloe, also known as 'Withnell' Cottage (16); Cook's Cottage (17); Gymnasium, with a kitchen at the rear to service the cottages (18); Administration Block, including welfare officers' interview rooms, homework room and library (19); and Vegetable Gardens and Sports Oval (22). The other buildings form the Salvation Army Senior Citizens' Village.

The aerial view must have been taken after 1970, which is when Cottesloe (Withnell) Cottage opened.</abstract>
