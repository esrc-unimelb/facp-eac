<abstract>Werribee Farm School, near Wundowie, was established by the Methodist Church in 1928 to train boys aged 10 to14 years in farm work. By 1953, girls were admitted to Werribee (then called 'Allandale') with their brothers. The property was sold in 1962.</abstract>
<p>Werribee Farm School, near Wundowie, was established by the Methodist Church in November 1928 to train boys aged 10 to14 years in farm work.</p>
<p>In 1938, the objectives of the Werribee Boys' Home (Farm School) were described in the <span style="font-style:italic"> Report by the Royal Commissioner on Youth Employment and the Apprenticeship System</span> (p.lxix) as 'housing and training boys in farm pursuits' and accommodating 'boys who, on prospects, appear to have less opportunity than the average boy (<span style="font-style:italic">e.g.</span>, boys from poor homes) and destitute orphan boys.'</p>
<p>The Royal Commissioner recommended (p.lxx) that the Government pay a maintenance allowance of 10 shillings per week for each 'destitute orphan boy' at Werribee provided the school undertook vocational and general education and training to the satisfaction of the Education Department. By 1940, this recommendation had not been implemented.</p>
<p>By 1953, girls were admitted to Werribee (by then called 'Allandale') with their brothers. The property was sold in 1962.</p>
