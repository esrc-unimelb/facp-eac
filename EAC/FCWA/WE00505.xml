<biogHist>
<abstract>The Redress WA scheme was established by the Government of Western Australia to acknowledge and apologise to adults who, as children, were abused and/or neglected while they were in the care of the state. It ran from 2008 to 31 December 2011.</abstract>
<p>The Redress WA scheme ran from 2008 to 31 December 2011. In its 2010-11 Annual Report, the Department for Communities described the scheme:</p>
<p>'Redress WA was established in 2008 as a finite scheme to acknowledge and apologise to adults who, as children, were abused and/or neglected while they were in the care of the state. Redress WA was based on four pillars of support: an opportunity to make a police referral; a personal apology from the Premier and Minister for Community Services; provision of support and counselling services; and ex gratia payments. Four broad levels of ex gratia payments were offered, ranging from a minimum of $5000 to a maximum of $45000.'</p>
<p>The four levels of payment were published in the Redress WA Guidelines on 18 May 2011:</p>
<list><item>Level 1: moderate abuse or neglect</item>
<item>Level 2: serious abuse or neglect with some ongoing symptoms and disabilities</item>
<item>Level 3: severe abuse or neglect with ongoing symptoms and disabilities</item>
<item>Level 4: very severe abuse or neglect with ongoing symptoms and disabilities</item></list>
<p>On 14 August 2012, in answer to questions put to her in the Legislative Council, the Minister for Community Services provided the following overview of the Redress WA Scheme:</p>
<list><br />
<item>5,212 payments totaling $117,740,167 were made from 5,225 offers</item>
<item>20 Redress WA claims were not finalised because: 9 applicants could not be contacted, 7 cases were due to the need to locate beneficiaries of deceased applicants, and 4 offers were rejected ($146,797 has gone to unclaimed monies)</item>
<item>859 Level 1 payments were made, from 866 offers</item>
<item>1,813 Level 2 payments were made, from 1,818 offers</item>
<item>1,477 Level 3 payments were made, from 1,478 offers</item>
<item>1,063 Level 4 payments were made, from 1,063 offers</item>
<item>120 applicants died before receiving final payments and 82 payments were made to deceased estates</item>
<item>40 applicants registered interest but did not make an application and 13 others withdrew their applications before they were finalised</item>
<item>519 applicants were determined to be ineligible for payment under the Redress WA Scheme</item>
<item>89 applicants appealed their first offer and 19 of those were successful on appeal</item>
<item>168 written requests for 'late applications' were received by the Department for Communities after the Redress WA Scheme closed</item>
<item>2,231 cases have been referred to police. 14 allegations of abuse were directed at households with people who were caring for children in 2012 and 29 alleged perpetrators in total had Working With Children Cards. These people were referred to the Department for Child Protection and Family Support for immediate assessment and 3 children were removed from these placements 'due to age and standard of care issues'</item>
<item>The number of applicants who had unclaimed wages arising from work they did while a Ward of the State was not collected</item>
<item> Information about the institutions where children who were State Wards suffered abuse was not collected in a database.</item></list>
<p>The Attorney General, on behalf of the Minister for Police on 14 August 2012, also tabled answers put to him in the Legislative Council about actions taken by the WA Police (up to 6 July 2012) on matters arising from the Redress WA Scheme. The Attorney General reported that 204 Redress WA cases were being investigated and 2 individuals had been charged.</p>
<p>One person had 93 Police Charges, which were:</p>
<list><br />
<item>37 counts of committing indecent practices between males (Section 184 of the Criminal Code)</item>
<item>33 counts of unlawfully and indecently assaulting a male child (Section 315 of the Criminal Code)</item>
<item>10 counts of indecent dealing of a child under 14 years (Section 183 of the Criminal Code)</item>
<item>6 counts of carnal knowledge against the order of nature (Section 181(1) of the Criminal Code)</item>
<item>6 counts of permitting a male to have carnal knowledge (Section 181(3) of the Criminal Code</item>
<item>1 count of attempted carnal knowledge (Section 182 of the Criminal Code).</item></list>
<p>The other person had 43 Police Charges, which were:</p>
<list><br />
<item>27 counts of indecent dealing of a child under 14 years (Section 183 of the Criminal Code)</item>
<item>7 counts of indecent dealing of a girl under 16 years (Section 189(1) of the Criminal Code)</item>
<item>6 counts of incest by a male (Section 197 of the Criminal Code)</item>
<item>2 counts of unlawful carnal knowledge of a child under 16 years (Section 187(1) of the Criminal Code)</item>
<item>1 count of attempted carnal knowledge (Section 182 of the Criminal Code).</item></list>

'The fact that more children were abused and have come forward than the former Government estimated is a cause for horror and sorrow,' said AFA and 'called on the WA Government to face the consequences of Government failures to care for children and to commit the funds that are needed to care for them as adults.'</abstract>

<unitdate>27 November 2009</unitdate>
<abstract>Pauline Bagdonavicius, the Public Advocate in Western Australia and a former Executive Director for the Department for Community Development in WA, delivered a speech about 'people with decision-making disabilities who experienced abuse as children in the care of the State' and for whom she, as the Public Advocate, made applications to Redress WA . Details of the process of those applications are included in the paper.
In her conclusion, the Public Advocate says that: 'Redress has been both a unique and important opportunity for the Office of the Public Advocate to undertake systemic advocacy as well as individual advocacy for each of our Redress applicants. In preparing the Redress applications, we have looked back on previous practices and are committed more than ever to moving forward with improved practices for the transition of young people with decision-making disabilities in the care of the Department for Child Protection and Family Support to the guardianship of the Public Advocate.'</abstract>

The newsletter has some words from the Minister: 'While I have been deeply saddened to learn about the distress expressed by many applicants as a consequence of their time in State Care, I have also been inspired by the courage demonstrated as applicants told their stories and recounted the wrongs done to them. I thank all applicants for their patience as they waited for their applications to be processed.'

<abstract>This newsletter from Redress WA announces that the ex-gratia payments are about to start, and lets people know about an important change to the scheme - psychological and medical assessments will no longer be needed to support applications. Another change that is announced is that people will not be asked to waive their rights to take other legal action when they accept their offer of payment from Redress WA.
The 'four broad levels of abuse and/or neglect' are defined in this newsletter:
<list><item>Moderate abuse and/or neglect suffered: $5,000</item>
<item>Serious abuse and/or neglect suffered with some ongoing symptoms and disability: $13,000</item>

<abstract>This statement, given in the Legislative Council of Western Australia by the Minister for Community Services, reports the completion of the Redress WA scheme and gives some statistics and costs. The Minister acknowledged the suffering experienced by applicants and outlined the way applicants responded to Redress WA: 'Applicants have told staff that their experience of applying was therapeutic, and receiving a call from a Redress staff member and being able to tell someone personally what happened to them was a positive experience. The fact that applicants were able to request a copy of their records of their time in care validated their experience as being believed and acknowledged, which for many was the most important part. I have also had feedback that the apology letter signed by me and the Premier was crucial to the healing process for many, and having an open line of contact with Redress staff while waiting for applications to be processed was reassuring.'</abstract>

The motion was lost by 3 votes.

The record shows that there were a number of interested people in the public gallery. Members spoke about their constituents' experiences in 'care' and with the Redress WA scheme. The debate concludes with an explanation of the Government's decision by the Premier, Mr Colin Barnett MLA.</abstract>
