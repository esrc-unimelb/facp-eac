<abstract>The Ugly Men's Voluntary Worker's Association Inc., also known as the Ugly Men's Association, 'Ugly Men' or 'Uglies' was a fund-raising and charitable organisation established in Western Australia in 1917, initially in response to concerns about the hardship experienced by the loss or absence of male breadwinners during World War One. The Uglies soon became involved in supporting Children's Homes and in the 1930s ran the Unemployed Boys' Farm at Bundidup. By the 1930s, the association was in decline and it was ceased in 1947, with its remaining assets vested in the Minister responsible for the <span style="font-style:italic">Charitable Collections Act 1946</span>.</abstract>
<p>The Ugly Men's Voluntary Worker's Association Inc., also known as the Ugly Men's Association, 'Ugly Men' or 'Uglies' was a fund-raising and charitable organisation established in Western Australia in 1917, initially in response to concerns about the hardship experienced by the loss or absence of male breadwinners during World War One. The Uglies soon became involved in supporting Children's Homes either by donating funds or providing children with entertainments. In 1924, they initiated a picnic for 'children of the orphanages of the metropolitan area' and this became an annual event for the next six years. The first year, there were separate picnics for girls' and boys' orphanages, held on 9 and 16 December, 1924. Concerts and other entertainments were also put on for the children in institutions, and members of the Uglies visited the institutions to distribute books and lollies.</p>
