<biogHist>
<abstract>Hollywood Childrens Village is a lever-arch file that contains photocopied information and images relating principally to the Salvation Army's Hollywood Children's Village, but also to Crossroads West which was the ongoing service after Hollywood closed. This file is part of the Salvation Army Heritage Museum WA, Children's Homes Files series of records held at the museum. There are no personal records in the file, but there are photographs of children, staff and facilities.</abstract>
<h4>Access Conditions</h4>
<p>Access to most items in the file is open, but it is essential to make an appointment to view.</p>
<h4>Records</h4>
<p>The Hollywood Childrens Village file contains photocopied information and images relating to the Salvation Army's Hollywood Children's Village, which was on the site of the former Salvation Army Boys' Home, Nedlands. Some documents are also relevant to Crossroads west and other Homes, including the Salvation Army Boys' Home, Nedlands; the Salvation Army Girls' Home, Cottesloe; Mirrabooka House; and Withnell House.</p>
<p>There are no personal records included in this file, but there are photographs of children and staff.</p>
<p>Some documents and photographs from the file are briefly described below:</p>
<h4>The End of an Era!</h4>
<p>This typed document appears to be notes for a speech written for the official closing ceremony of the Hollywood Children's Village. On that basis, the document can be dated to 1994. It includes a brief statement by TG Ferniough, recalling girls from the Salvation Army Girls' Home, Cottesloe, visiting corps on Sundays. In his statement, Ferniough also reflects on the changing models of residential accommodation offered by the Salvation Army - from the large Home at Cottesloe with 100 girls and only seven staff in 1926, to cottage homes from the 1960s, and foster care in the 1990s.</p>
<h4>Back to Hollywood Children's Village</h4>
<p>Dated 23 September 1994, this document is a letter of invitation to a Salvation Army officer to attend the closing ceremony for the Hollywood Children's Village. The letter states that the last residential unit at the Village will close later in 1994.</p>
<h4>Closure of Childrens Village</h4>
<p>This letter, dated 17 May 1990, explains the shift from cottage parent style accommodation to an 'expanded youth programme' at the Hollywood Children's Village. The letter also notes that around 50% of referrals to the Village were for children over 12 years, and that a cottage parent model was not appropriate for teenagers.</p>
<h4>Official Opening of Swimming Pool</h4>
<p>This is typed document with the Salvation Army logo, outlines the program for the official opening ceremony of the swimming pool at the Hollywood Children's Village on Saturday 27 March 1971 at 1.45pm. The Children's Choir would perform and the plaque would be unveiled by the Mayor of Nedlands, Mr J. Chas Smith.</p>
<h4>Photographs from the 'Back to Hollywood Children's Village Day' held in October 1994</h4>
<p>There are a number of photographs from the event held prior to the closure of the last remaining residential unit on the Hollywood Children's Village site. Photographs include images of children, staff and facilities for Buckingham Cottage (images from 1977-1983); Salvation Army Boys' Home, Nedlands; Mirrabooka House; Withnell House (Cottesloe Cottage); and Hollywood Children's Village generally.</p>
<h4>Photographs from the opening ceremony for Withnell Cottage (Cottesloe House), 1972</h4>
<p>There are a number of black and white images of children, staff and official visitors (including Hon Premier John Tonkin MLA).</p>
