<abstract>The Children and Community Services Act 2004 (Act no.2004/034) is the principal legislation governing the care and protection of children in Western Australia. It is administered by the government department responsible for the welfare of children. In 2014, this was the Department for Child Protection and Family Support. The purpose outlined in the Act is broad. It seeks to promote the wellbeing of children, other individuals, families and communities and to acknowledge the primary role of parents, families and communities in safeguarding and promoting the wellbeing of children. The Act aims to encourage and support parents, families and communities in carrying out that role. It provides for the protection and care of children in circumstances where their parents have not given, or are unlikely or unable to give, that protection and care. The Children and Community Services Act 2004 repealed the Child Welfare Act 1947, and the Community Services Act 1972.</abstract>
