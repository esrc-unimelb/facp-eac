<abstract>St Joseph's Home was also known as Meteor Park Orphanage and Neerkol Orphanage. The St Joseph's Home Records are held by the Sisters of Mercy. They comprise Registers dating from 1885 to 1968, Registers from 1960 to 1979.</abstract>
<h4>Access Conditions</h4>
<p>Requests for personal information need to be made in writing. This information can be gained by anyone who is able to identify themselves as having a right to personal information. A computer print-out is available of all information recorded from the books of original entry. Physical access to the records is not available due to their fragility and the need to protect the privacy of others.</p>
<h4>Records</h4>

<item>Some other individual photographs</item></list>
<p>There are many discrepancies in the records particularly with regard to the children's names eg. The child's name is recorded in the Register but they are known by another Christian name or surname; similarly the same discrepancy occurs with date, admission, discharge etc.</p>
<p>There are 210 names in the school register that have been omitted from the admission register. These have been added to the computerfiles and date from 1930 to 1975.</p>
<p>Because records for some periods are inaccurate and inadequate, there are errors and omissions.</p>
