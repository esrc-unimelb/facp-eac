<biogHist>
<abstract>Mittagong Cottage Homes were established from 1885 by the State Children's Relief Board. They were houses that each held 20 children, ranging in age from infancy to adolescence. The first were in the Mittagong township but in 1896 they moved to the Southwood Estate on Bong Bong Road, where further cottages were added. The cottages had different functions, as hospitals, disability and truancy institutions, convalescent homes, transit points between foster placements and the reformatory Mittagong Farm School and Training School. More than 30,000 state children passed through the cottages. In 1976 the entire complex of buildings and farming land was renamed Renwick.</abstract>
<p>The Mittagong Cottage Homes had an important role in the New South Wales Government's child welfare system. They were started by the first president of the State Children's Relief Board, Arthur Renwick, and were organised on a cottage basis. Although they were most certainly institutions, Renwick argued that cottage care was an extension of the boarding-out (fostering) system, as the homes were small and were modelled on the nuclear family. Children at Mittagong were considered by the State Children's Relief Board to be boarded out, rather than institutionalised. Mittagong, it was argued, had a healthy climate which enabled children to gain health and strength and was surrounded by good farming land, which provided the food necessary to run the homes.</p>
<p>Up to 230 children were on the site at any given time. Each cottage held around 20 children, under the care of matrons or, in later years, house parents. The cottages had different uses and specialised in providing health care, education, nursing or training. Children at Mittagong received a boosted diet, rich in dairy foods, oats, treacle and vegetables, to help them grow stronger and overcome the diseases and ailments they might have suffered during their early lives.</p>
<p>Children were housed in the cottages at Mittagong because they were severely neglected and unable to be placed with foster mothers, because they were sick or had disabilities, needed nursing or special education, or because they were thought to require training as farm workers and domestic servants. Some sections of the Cottages, like the Farm Home or Training Home, functioned as industrial schools or reformatories for children, although of a milder form than those at Parramatta and Gosford.</p>
<p>The first cottage was opened in rented premises in Mittagong township on 21 March 1885 and was for 'delicate and invalid children'. Within a short period six cottages had been established, including one for ophthalmia (eye disease), which was unfortunately common in children who had been taken into state care. Cottages were later established for children with skin conditions, physical disability and other illnesses, 'feeble-mindedness' and 'mental deficiency' and behaviour problems.</p>
<p>In 1896 the State Children's Relief Department leased 100 acres of the 'Southwood Estate'. The farm was worked by old men from the Government Asylum, and a number of cottages were built on it, while surrounding houses were converted to hold children. In 1902 the NSW Government bought the land and the Mittagong cottages commenced their dual role as a cottage for 'mentally defective' girls and the Mittagong Farm Home, for 'delinquent' boys. From that point the boys took over the farm work and provided the fruit, vegetables and milk needed to run this substantial institution.</p>
<p>In November 1914 the <span style="font-style:italic">Herald</span> visited Mittagong, as a response to a squabble between Charles Mackellar, outgoing president of the State Children's Relief Board, and Catholic Archbishop Kelly, who had said that the Catholic Westmead Children's Home was a true home, and Mittagong was like a prison, and ignored the spiritual welfare of Catholic children. Mackellar had published his objections and also written to Cardinal Moran. The <span style="font-style:italic">Herald</span> made an unannounced visit, at Mackellar's invitation, but clearly took sides, describing Mackellar as 'The Children's Friend':</p>
<p>'In the visitors' book in the largest of the homes [run by Mr and Mrs AE Boswell] someone has written: "Helping those who never had a chance." And that is the truth of it. The lads who are there have been taken from the evil surroundings of former days and placed in a home that is scrupulously neat and clear, and is bright with beautiful flowers. They have been taken from parents who have wilfully neglected them, or have confessed their inability to control them, and in those at the head of the home they find new and better parents, who spend their lives in trying to make good citizens of them. Some stay but a few months and are allowed to go back to their own homes, though they still remain under the protecting care of probation officers. Some stay for a considerable time, and after being taught a trade are apprenticed out and given a fair chance in the world. All who are under 14 years of age are sent to school, "and a bright and intelligent lot they are, too," said Mr Thresher, the headmaster of the school.'</p>
<p>According to this report there were two cottages in town, which held 50 girls who did most of the laundry, sewing and housework for the institution. On a 640 acre site three miles from town were eight boys' cottages, which held 300 boys.</p>
<p>According to this journalist, the discipline at the home taught self-reliance and independence.</p>
<p>'In a word, they are put upon their honour. And there is nothing inherently bad in these boys and girls, taken as a whole-they have simply lacked a restraining influence in the past, and have been allowed, so to speak, to grow wild.'</p>
<p>Of religious matters, the journalist said the children were divided on sectarian lines: Catholics were cared for by Catholic house parents and Protestants were cared for by Protestant parents, and all children learned to say their prayers, to say grace and walked into Mittagong every Sunday to attend their own churches.</p>
<p>In 1916 and 1917 two NSW Parliamentary inquiries looked into the discipline provided at Mittagong, as part of a broader inquiry into the boarding out system. An account of these inquiries is in Naomi Parry's PhD thesis, '"Such a longing": black and white welfare in NSW and Tasmania, 1880-1940'. Girls who had lived in the homes in the 1890s told the inquiry that they were brutalised while in the care of matrons at the Mittagong Homes, and suffered the indignity of having their heads shaved and being beaten for failings like dropping clothes pegs. The inquiries dismissed the complaints, stating that they had occurred long ago and Mittagong was much improved.</p>
<p>By 1919 there were 11 cottages in use, eight for delinquents, two for dependents and one for mentally defective young boys &amp; girls. Some cottages housed up to 20 children at a time. There were about 230 children resident, some going to school &amp; others involved in training programmes. These programmes included orcharding, dairying, general farming, tailoring, bootmaking, carpentry, poultry and pig farming.</p>
<p>Throughout this period the cottages in the township remained in use as institutions, but townspeople eventually pressured the government to centralise the cottages on the 'Southwood Estate'. This led to the buying of 'Rotherwood estate', a ten acre property on which Rotherwood cottage now stands, in April 1930. The house on the property was used as the hospital cottage until 1976.</p>
<p>During the early years of Mittagong Cottage Homes, the cottages were simply numbered, from 1 to 12. Sometimes the Department's annual reports mention an unofficial title such as 'Home for Feeble-Minded Girls' or 'Ophthalmic Home' or 'Home for Boys'. Some time in the 1940s, the cottages were given names. The names were usually those of people who had been significant in the history of the Child Welfare Department. The names were:</p>
<list><item>Hayden</item>
<item>Goodlet</item>
<item>Jefferis</item>
<item>Delauret</item>
<item>Mackellar</item>
<item>Rowe</item>
<item>Turner Cottage, which in 1960 housed 27 boys of primary school age</item>
<item>Suttor Cottage, which catered to slightly older boys</item>
<item>Renwick Cottage, which held 20 primary school age boys and in 1976 became the name for the entire site</item>
<item>Linden Cottage, opened on 17 May 1968, which was for primary school age girls</item>
<item>Rotherwood Cottage, opened in February 1969, for boys, and</item>
<item>Garran Cottage, opened in 1969, 'of modern design', which catered 
for primary school age girls</item></list>
<p>Waverley dates from the 1940s. It was described by Donald McLean in 1955 as a home for children aged 2 to 6 years who were wards of the state and defined as 'unplaceable'. The goal of the home was to educate them and build them up physically so they could be fostered. It had a trained kindergarten teacher. Two sixteen year old state ward girls assisted the staff in the home, as did townspeople and girls from Frensham, the neighbouring private school. By the 1960s this housed children of primary school age.</p>
<p>Challoner, which children from the Mittagong Cottages were involved in building, also dates from around 1941 and was originally a home for boys who were considered delinquent.</p>
<p>A school was built at the site in 1959, originally to be called the 'Lower Mittagong School' but eventually called Toombong School.
The Department admitted in its Annual Report of that year that it 
wanted to avoid any connotation that the school was 'lower' than any of the other local schools. Another school, called Southwood, was built later and in 1970 became the 
Child Welfare Department's first co-educational school. At 
different times, some children in some of the homes went to this
 Department school, while others went 'out' to the local primary school 
in Mittagong.</p>
<p>The State Heritage Register listing states that former residents of Mittagong Cottage Homes and Renwick feel a strong attachment to Challoner, in particular. In 2012 it was in poor condition, boarded up but still standing near the Federation-style Goodlet, Heydon and DeLauret Cottages. In 2014, local groups were still trying to secure its future, and to gain recognition for the site as a whole. Most of the later buildings and outbuildings have been demolished and cleared away.</p>
