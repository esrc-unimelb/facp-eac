<biogHist>
<abstract>Taldree was opened in 1974 by the Department of Youth and Community Services in Parramatta. It was located in new buildings on part of the site of the Parramatta Girls' Training School, which was officially closed in 1975. Taldree was a remand centre that took in up to 60 boys under 16 years for about two weeks at a time, including boys from Minda Remand Centre in Lidcombe. When Taldree closed in 1980 the boys were transferred to Werrington Park. The Taldree section was then renamed Kamballa.</abstract>
<p>Taldree was officially opened on 10 December, 1974 as a remand centre for junior boys, having admitted its first residents in July 1974. The Centre was located in new buildings on part of the site of the former Parramatta Girls' Training School in Fleet Street, Parramatta. Parramatta had been the subject of a strong public campaign for more compassionate treatment of children in the child welfare and juvenile detention systems and they creation of Taldree and Kamballa were a direct response to that by the government.</p>
<p>Taldree was residential accommodation for up to 60 boys at one time. A school building was added, to provide basic skills education, because many of the boys were educationally disadvantaged. The average length of stay at Taldree was two weeks. The school accommodation was shared with the girls from Kamballa but neither classes nor playgrounds were mixed. The two homes also shared administrative staff.</p>
<p>When Taldree closed in May 1980, its buildings were renamed Kamballa. From 1983 they were used by the Department of Youth and Community Services as administrative buildings. This use continued until 2009, under the Department of Community Services.</p>
<p>The Girls Training School Precinct, 1 Fleet St, Parramatta, NSW, Australia has been listed on the Register of the National Estate since 21 March 1978.</p>

<abstract>Abandon All Hope is the first documented history of the Parramatta Girls Home - a project made possible through the Parrastories Heritage and Stories fund, Parramatta City Council. Until now the story of this State operated welfare institution has remained relatively unknown.

The document examines the site's archaeological heritage together with an overview of the statutory and societal forces and the individual and collective experiences of the young people who once resided within its walls. Copies of the publication are available from the Parramatta Heritage Centre.</abstract>
