<biogHist>
<abstract>Allanville Home was established at Wellington by the Department of Community Services as a receiving home for state wards. It was established in the mid-1970s and housed 15 children at a time. Allanville Home closed by the late 1990s.</abstract>
<p>A search of available information about Allanville Home turns up both positive and negative stories. In 2003 the <span style="font-style:italic">Wellington Times</span> reported that a retired racehorse, Jack, had died at the age of 29. Jack had been loaned to Don Graham, a former worker at the home, in the late 1970s. The newspaper quoted Mr Graham:</p>
<p>'We had 15 kids in care. Often one of the kids would bring home a stray dog or cat, but they were unable to keep them. So I thought it might be a good thing if I could bring old Jack up to Allanville. He worked wonders with them, many learning to ride him. And he sure loved the cuddles he got from them.</p>
<p>Don said he had some explaining to do to their cook, Mrs Cummings, when she checked out the pantry one day and found three-quarters of a case of apples and six loaves of bread missing. "Old Jack loved his snack. The kids said Jack also was a bit of a rogue - he loved trimming up my old mate next door Spratty's roses."</p>
<p>"One evening I received a phone call from one of the kids' mothers that had Jack out for a ride. She said that Jack was in the bad books. The kids had tied him up near a big open window to their lounge room. Jack being Jack had poked his head inside and drank the fish tank empty. And a gold fish was missing. It's true."</p>
<p>Don said people often inquired about Jack. "Not so long ago, one of the kids that used to ride Jack - she's an adult now - said to me: 'Mr Graham, it's funny, when growing up as a child I hardly remember the things I used to do, but I will never forget the great time I had with old Jack."</p>
<p>Don said he was very saddened when an old mate, Lindsay Dawson, told him that Jack had died. "He was wonderful therapy for many people."'</p>
<p>A much less happy memory for former residents was revealed in 2007, when Wongarbon man David John Boddy admitted sexually abusing 17 boys, from 1977 onwards. He was sentenced to a minimum of 16 years jail. Boddy was a former registered carer for the Department of Community Services and supervised boys at the Allanville Home. Boddy had gained access to boys through church and 'caring' activities.</p>
<p>In 2014, Allanville is a private residence.</p>
