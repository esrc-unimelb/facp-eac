<biogHist>
<abstract>Mittagong Farm Home for Boys was established at Mittagong in 1906. It was a government-run Probationary Training Home for boys aged 8 to 17 who had been convicted in the Children's Courts. Mittagong Farm Home for Boys was part of Mittagong Cottage Homes. It became the Mittagong Training School For Boys in 1947.</abstract>
<p>The Mittagong Farm Home opened on 17 October 1906. It was situated on land already used as cottage-style accommodation for state children who were sick or invalid. Mittagong was organised on the cottage system, with an officer and his wife attached to each home. When Gosford Farm Home opened in 1912 Mittagong Farm Home was reserved for younger boys.</p>
<p>In November 1914 Charles Mackellar, the President of the State Children's Relief Board wrote to <span style="font-style:italic">The Sydney Morning Herald</span> to defend the Mittagong Farm Homes against criticisms made in the same paper by the Catholic Archbishop Dr Kelly. Mackellar's letter gives an overview of the approach of the State Children's Relief Board to the discipline, care and religious instruction of the children at the home:<br />
'The report says that at a meeting of the Westmead Catholic Homes for Boys "Dr Kelly said that the institution (i.e., the Westmead Home) was a home in the true sense of the word - not like the State Home at Mittagong with its prison conditions, where nearly every child had a policeman's hand on his shoulder, etc., etc." I shall refrain from stigmatising Dr Kelly's remarks in any harsher way than by saying that they give an absolutely incorrect idea of the management of the Mittagong Farm, and I would invite you to send one of your reporters to examine the Mittagong Homes and inquire into the methods used to control the children there, and report the result In your columns.<br />
'</p>
<p>Kelly's remarks were probably exaggerated. The goal of organisations like Westmead was to ensure Catholic children did not receive Protestant religious instruction and Kelly was undoubtedly urging donors to fund the homes, just as some Protestant clergymen encouraged donors to fund Protestant children's homes by condemning Catholics. But Mackellar was so angry he wrote to Cardinal Moran and copied his letter to the newspaper.</p>
<p>Mackellar told Cardinal Moran that Archbishop Kelly had in fact visited Mittagong four years previously and had praised it. He pointed out that the State Children's Relief Board tried to look after the spiritual welfare of Catholic children by employing Catholic staff, sending them to a Catholic service on Sundays and allowing visits from the neighbouring Marist Brothers community. Mackellar then described the discipline at Mittagong Farm Homes:<br />
'The discipline of the institution was referred to by the Archbishop as being in effect little different to that of a prison. Now, if there is one attribute making for successful reformation which the department has ever striven after in its treatment of children in these [state] institutions it is that the whole system shall be as unlike the old method in its attempts at reformation as it is possible to have it. Barrack like buildings have been superseded by cottages, bright with their own gardens and replete with every comfort suggesting "home." The officials approach the home idea altogether, in that a man and wife ("mother" and "father") are in charge of each cottage. No uniforms are worn by officials or children, no bolts bars, or locks are visible or allowed, and the children are given the greatest amount of liberty compatible with proper order and discipline. They go to the public school from their respective homes to their various avocations at the farm, workshops, etc â€¦ Where, then, is the semblance even of prison discipline?'</p>
<p>Later in November 1914 the <span style="font-style:italic">Herald</span> visited Mittagong and wrote a glowing article that called Mackellar 'The Children's Friend':<br />
'In the visitors' book in the largest of the homes [run by Mr and Mrs AE Boswell] someone has written: "Helping those who never had a chance." And that is the truth of it. The lads who are there have been taken from the evil surroundings of former days and placed in a home that is scrupulously neat and clear, and is bright with beautiful flowers. They have been taken from parents who have wilfully neglected them, or have confessed their inability to control them, and in those at the head of the home they find new and better parents, who spend their lives in trying to make good citizens of them. Some stay but a few months and are allowed to go back to their own homes, though they still remain under the protecting care of probation officers. Some stay for a considerable time, and after being taught a trade are apprenticed out and given a fair chance in the world. All who are under 14 years of age are sent to school, "and a bright and intelligent lot they are, too," said Mr Thresher, the headmaster of the school.'</p>
<p>According to this report there were two cottages in town, which held 50 girls who did most of the laundry, sewing and housework for the institution. On a 640 acre site three miles from town were eight boys' cottages, which held 300 boys.</p>
<p>The <span style="font-style:italic">Herald</span> correspondent was sympathetic to the boys' stories, describing one who was committed at 13 to Mittagong because he had run away from work. He told the journalist he had done so because he was working from dawn until 7pm every day skinning rabbits, but only got 2 shillings a week. Other boys were brought in because they had been sleeping out, or committed minor thefts. The journalist certainly felt most of them accepted their situation:<br />
'The first few days are the hardest-to bear. The child arrives among strangers in a strange part of the country, and his thoughts naturally go back to the home he has left no matter how bad a home it has been. But he very soon settles down to the new life, and begins to enjoy it. His pinched face fills out, and with a comfortable bed to sleep on and plenty of good food to eat, with happy companions and, above all, the kind mother heart of the matron beating for him as if he were her own child, he very soon forgets his troubles, and settles down as "one of the boys." '</p>
<p>According to this journalist, the discipline at the home taught self-reliance and independence.<br />
'In a word, they are put upon their honour. And there is nothing inherently bad in these boys and girls, taken as a whole-they have simply lacked a restraining influence in the past, and have been allowed, so to speak, to grow wild.'</p>
<p>Of religious matters, the journalist said the children were divided on sectarian lines: Catholics were cared for by Catholic house parents and Protestants were cared for by Protestant parents, and all children learned to say their prayers, to say grace and walked into Mittagong every Sunday to attend their own churches.</p>
<p>In 1947 this Institution became known as Mittagong Training School for Boys. The Mittagong Cottages were later renamed Renwick, and closed in the early 1990s. The site was sold by the New South Wales Government in the 1990s, to Landcom, and is being subdivided and developed, resulting in substantial loss of buildings and heritage.</p>
