<biogHist>
<abstract>Kamballa was formally established in 1975 by the Department of Youth and Community Services, although it was used from mid-1974. Taldree was established at the same time, in a separate building on the site, which had been Parramatta Girls' Training School. Kamballa was a training school for girls aged 15 to 18 who were defined as having emotional or behavioural problems. In 1980 Taldree closed and Kamballa moved into its building. The old building became Norma Parker Detention Centre. In 1983 Kamballa was converted to offices.</abstract>
<p>Kamballa was formed as a response to public concern about the government's management of Parramatta Girls' Training School. As Bonney Djuric has written, from the early 1970s members of Sydney's women's movement, including the legendary feminist Bessie Guthrie, had protested about the conditions at Parramatta and its annexe, Hay Institution for Girls, and the pressure had contributed to the government's decision to amend the <span style="font-style:italic">Child Welfare Act</span> to, as Child Welfare Minister Richard Healey said at the time, 'to reflect the most positive attitudes of a modern community towards its minors and get rid of any Dickensian overtones.' [<span style="font-style:italic">Abandon All Hope</span>]</p>
<p>According to <span style="font-style:italic">Archives Investigator</span>, on 7 March 1975 the former Parramatta Girl's Training Home was proclaimed, under the <span style="font-style:italic">Child Welfare Act, 1939</span> as 'a school for the reception, detention, maintenance, discipline, education and training of children and young persons committed to an institution to be known as "Kamballa".'</p>
<p>Kamballa opened on 31 October 1974 and took in its first girls in December 1974 and January 1975. The unit was designed to cater for the needs of girls found unsuitable for other training schools. The emphasis of the institution was to provide extensive counselling and vocational and educational opportunities to facilitate individual development. Although it was in the 'old home' building, the atmosphere was much more relaxed, there were fewer girls and the 'training features' like laundry work, scrubbing and 'standing out' that had made life so difficult for girls at Parramatta were gone. Kamballa shared a new school building with Taldree, but there was no mixing of the children from the two institutions.</p>
<p>In May-June 1980 Kamballa's former premises, the main building of Parramatta Girl's Training School, were transferred to the Department of Corrective Services for conversion to the Norma Parker Centre. Kamballa moved to adjacent premises formerly occupied by the Taldree Remand Centre for boys. Kamballa closed as a residential facility in 1983. The buildings remained a Department of Community Services administrative centre until 2009.</p>
<p>The Girls Training School Precinct, 1 Fleet St, Parramatta, NSW, Australia has been listed on the Register of the National Estate since 21 March 1978.</p>

<unitdate>1975</unitdate>
<abstract>This is a digital copy of an image that appeared in the <span style="font-style:italic">Sunday Sun-Herald</span> on 4 November 2012.

The title for this photograph was provided by the newspaper. Information from care leavers is that this image was not from Parramatta Girls Home but was taken during the time the institution was renamed Kamballa, and renovated. As one former resident of Parramatta Girls Home stated 'Parramatta Girls' Home did not allow short skirts. We were not allowed to sit around playing records and we definitely did not play with a dog! PGH was an inhumane, brutal, strict institution.'

Parramatta was unofficially known as Kamballa from December 1973 and formally renamed in March 1974. The Suzi Quatro single the girls are holding was released in June 1973 and was Australian number one that October, making it likely the photograph was taken in or after late 1973. The dog most probably belonged to the superintendent, and its presence, as well as the fact the girls are wearing jewellery and clothes they were normally prevented from having, indicates the photograph was staged, possibly to publicise the government's attempts to modernise the institution.</abstract>

<abstract>Abandon All Hope is the first documented history of the Parramatta Girls Home - a project made possible through the Parrastories Heritage and Stories fund, Parramatta City Council. Until now the story of this State operated welfare institution has remained relatively unknown.

The document examines the site's archaeological heritage together with an overview of the statutory and societal forces and the individual and collective experiences of the young people who once resided within its walls.
