<abstract>Photographs of Salvation Army Children's Homes (1922-1993) consists of approximately 400 photographs of Salvation Army children's homes across New South Wales and Queensland, taken from 1922 to 1993 at 13 different Salvation Army children's homes. The NSW homes included in the photographs are Algate House, Arncliffe Girl's Home, Bexley Boys' Home, Dulwich Hill Family Group Home, La Perouse Women and Children's Home, Canowindra Girls' Home, and Stanmore Children's Home. The Queensland homes include Alkira Salvation Army Home for Boys, Home for Boys Riverview, Salvation Army Home for Girls, Yeronga, and Salvation Army Girl's Home, Toowong.</abstract>
<h4>Access Conditions</h4>
<p>Photographs will be accessible to the public, but permission will be required to view the photographs.</p>
<h4>Records</h4>
<p>These photographs are a mixture of official photographs taken of the homes, as well as personal photos that were donated by various people.</p>
<p>The official photographs of the various homes show the interior and exterior of the children's homes; the children, staff, managers and Salvation Army officers who were stationed there across the time period. Many of these photographs have been dated and identified by retired and current Salvation Army officers, and people who grew up and were a part of The Salvation Army children's homes.</p>
<p>The photographs of people are both formal and informal. They show children and staff participating in recreational activities; such as sport, excursions, holidays and Christmas parties, as well as events; such as local fetes, church events, Christmas day, school and group portraits, and the children's homes brass bands and musical groups. The Salvation Army officers (managers) were often photographed in the Salvation Army uniform.</p>
<p>These photographs are located at The Salvation Army Heritage Centre in North Bexley, Sydney.</p>
