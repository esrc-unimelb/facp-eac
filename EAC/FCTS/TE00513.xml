<abstract>The Records of the Industrial School for Girls - Hobart, held by the Morris Miller Library at the University of Tasmania, date from 1862 to 1945. The records include minutes, admission registers, a list of the girls, accounts, annual reports, miscellaneous papers, and 2 photographs of the School. They are a rich source of information about the circumstances and experiences of individual girls, life at the school, and decisions made by the Committee.</abstract>

<h4>Records</h4>
<list><item>Minutes of the Management Committee (June 1862-February 1945) - The committee met monthly to deal with all aspects of the School's life. Their minutes contain information about the staff, meals, bedding, the girls' clothing, their activities (mostly needlework, laundry, and schooling), the circumstances of their parents, reasons for committal, behaviour, and illnesses or deaths, as well as destinations and progress after leaving the home. They name a number of girls. They also include the handover of the School to the Salvation Army in 1945. There are some newspaper clippings, mostly concerning Annual General Meetings.</item>
<item>Minutes of the Governors and Trustees (July-November 1882) - concern plans, estimates, and tenders for repairs to the roof of Kensington House, Davey Street.</item>
<item>Admission Registers (1864-1895 and 1869-1888) - contains names with the ages and dates of admission, under whose authority a girl was admitted, for instance, a Justice of the Peace, and the length of time she spent in the School. The Registers sometimes include the date of discharge, where the girl went to work, and the names of the parents. There are two overlapping volumes, possibly kept by two people. After 1880, the entries seem to be irregular.</item>
<item>List of Girls (1902-1945) - this list is alphabetical. It contains basic information about the names, ages, dates of admission, and dates and places of service for most of the girls. In some instances, the entries are fuller, including the religions of girls, their condition on arrival, who they married, and their behaviour.</item>
<item>Treasurer's Expenditure Accounts (1882-1930 and 1930-1934) - contains information about spending on wages, food, clothing, fuel and light, printing, furniture, repairs, and soap.</item>
