<biogHist>
<abstract>Certified children's Homes were, between 1896 and 1960, run by voluntary organisations and certified by the government.</abstract>
<p>Under the 1896 <span style="font-style:italic">Youthful Offenders, Destitute and Neglected Children Act</span>, industrial schools could be certified. According to the section 48 of the Act:</p>
<p>'The Minister may, upon the application of the Governors of an Industrial School, examine into the conditions and regulations thereof, and may by writing under his hand certify that such School is fitted for the reception of such children as may be sent there in pursuance of this Act; and thereupon the School shall be deemed a certified Industrial School.'</p>
<p>Section 52 made a similar provision for training schools:</p>
<p>'The Minister may, upon the application of the Managers of any Training School for the better training of youthful offenders, examine into the condition and regulation of the School, and may, by writing under his hand, certify that such School is fitted for the reception of youthful offenders as may be sent there in pursuance of this Act, and the same shall be deemed a certified Training School. No substantial alteration shall be made in or to the buildings of any Training School without the approval in writing of the Minister.'</p>
<p>The Secretary of the Neglected Children's Department could, with the Minister's approval, transfer the guardianship of children he placed in a certified industrial or training school from himself to the Managers of that institution.</p>
<p>Section 19 of the 1918 <span style="font-style:italic">Children of the State Act</span> extended these provisions so that:</p>
<list><item>The Managers of certified institutions could not make changes to the buildings of these Homes without obtaining permission of the Minister.</item>
<item> If a Minister was not satisfied with the conditions of the Home, he could withdraw the certificate after giving six months notice. Alternatively, the Minister could refuse to admit children to the institution for a specific period of time.</item>
<item>Managers who wished to resign the certification of their Home had to give six months notice.</item> <item>State wards could no longer be admitted to a Home if its certification was about to be withdrawn but those children who were already there had to be accommodated until the certification expired.</item>
<item>The Managers of a certified Home could refuse to accept a ward of state but once he or she was admitted they had to accommodate him or her until the child's period of detention expired.</item>
<item>The Managers were entitled to receive financial support for each ward of state from the government.</item></list>
<p>Under Section 11 of the <span style="font-style:italic">Children of the State Act</span>, the Managers of the institution became the guardians of wards of state.</p>
<p>Section 15 of the 1935 <span style="font-style:italic">Infants' Welfare Act</span> made the same provisions as those set out in the <span style="font-style:italic">Children of the State Act</span>. Managers of certified institutions remained the guardians of wards of state.</p>
<p>In 1960, under the <span style="font-style:italic">Child Welfare Act</span>, certified children's Homes became approved children's Homes.</p>
