<biogHist>
<abstract>Child welfare officers carried-out preventive work, reported to the Children's Court and supervised children under court orders, wards of state living with their own families, in foster homes, institutions and on work placements. They licensed nurseries and homes where children were privately boarded, found foster homes, and assessed the suitability of prospective adoptive parents. In addition, they worked with parents living in poverty. Six honorary child welfare officers helped them.</abstract>
<p>In the 1970s, the work of child welfare officers emphasised working with families to prevent their children from becoming state wards. They became involved after a complaint or if the parents asked for help in managing a child's behaviour. Initially they worked with the parents to improve the situation. Usually one or two interviews were enough but if the family appeared to need more, the officer placed the child or children on a preventive supervision list. Child welfare officers visited the home and parents made regular visits to the office for interviews and referral to other services. The aim of preventive work was to keep families together and stop the children from getting into trouble with the law. Children became wards of state when this process failed. After that, child welfare officers supervised them. The Division would try to obtain maintenance from parents. This was not always possible as they were often too poor.</p>
<p>Child welfare officers registered and inspected the foster homes of state wards as well as children who were not wards but lived away from their parents, guardians, or families.</p>
<p>In 1961, the Social Welfare Department took over responsibility for adoptions from the Registrar-General's Department. Women child welfare officers approved potential adoptive parents, talked to relinquishing mothers, and found placements for their babies. By the 1970s, many more mothers were able to keep their babies. This meant that the welfare officer's role changed to helping the mother to make the decision and, if she kept the baby, putting her on the single mother's allowance, and maintaining regular contact in order to offer support.</p>
<p>Under the <span style="font-style:italic">Matrimonial Causes Act</span> 1959, at the court's request, child welfare officers investigated the plans made by divorcing parents to look after their children.</p>
<p>Until the 1980s, one child welfare officer tended to work every field of child welfare work. After that, they became specialised. There were now children's court officers, adoption officers, placement officers, and staff working in the regional resource units.</p>
<p>Providing adequate training for child welfare officers had a slow start in Tasmania. In 1963, the Annual Report of the Social Welfare Department said that the absence of a university course in social science made it difficult for the Department to recruit specifically qualified child welfare officers. Instead it employed people qualified as teachers or nurses. There were social welfare courses at the Technical Colleges but they lacked a thoroughgoing education in practical and theoretical social work. Tasmania was the only state in Australia without a degree course in social science.</p>
<p>In 1970, the Department began granting post-graduate scholarships in social administration to be studied at Flinders University. This appears to have provided child welfare officers with much needed training and to have made the workforce more professional. In 1974, the College of Advanced Education in Hobart began offering post-graduate courses in social work so the Department discontinued the arrangement with Flinders University. The Department also offered in-service and on the job training to child welfare officers.</p>
