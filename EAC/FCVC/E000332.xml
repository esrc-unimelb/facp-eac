<biogHist>
<abstract>The Lutheran Peace Memorial Home was established in 1950 by the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Australia. It housed the children of widows who migrated to Australia following World War Two, to enable the women to work. In the 1970s, the model of 'care' shifted to family group homes in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne. In the early 1980s, the Lutheran Church relocated its services for children to the Glenelg area in western Victoria.</abstract>
<p>The Lutheran Peace Memorial Children's Home was officially opened on 22 October 1950. It was originally located at 760 Canterbury Road, Surrey Hills.</p>
<p>The Home was established to care for the children of widows who migrated to Australia following the war, to enable the women to work. In 1954, the Home housed 38 children aged from 4 to 14 of 11 nationalities, mainly from Eastern European backgrounds. Registration of the Home as a charitable organisation from the Hospital and Charities Commission was granted in 1952 on condition that a number of improvements were made. A decision was made instead to sell the home and purchase a larger property.</p>
<p>A suitable property was purchased at 52 Sackville Street, Kew and officially opened on 5 May 1955. This Home was an old two-storey mansion-type home, set in a well-kept garden with two downstairs dormitories for girls and two dormitories upstairs for boys. At the time of the opening three-quarters of the children were Lutheran; about half of these were children of immigrant parents.</p>
<p> In June 1956 the Home was gazetted as an approved Children's Home by the Children's Welfare Act 1954. At that time, the Home had total bed accommodation for 42 children between the ages of 4 to 14 (in the mid 1960s, the age limit was raised to 15). As the number of migrant children decreased, the Home began taking in other children needing care, including children who had been made wards of the State.</p>
<p>Following concerns from the Social Welfare Department, the Family Welfare Advisory Council assessed the Home in 1966. Changes were made on the basis of the Council's recommendations, including renovations to the Kew property, increasing staff/children ratios, increasing staff training and moving towards the family group home model of care.</p>
<p>In 1968 the majority of children placed were state wards and 'private placements' of children. Holiday Hosts (Lutheran families) living in the city and country were approved to take the children to their homes over the school holiday period.</p>
<p>The Lutheran Teenage Family Care Home at 755 Station Street Box Hill was officially opened on 28 March 1971 to continue the care of teenage children too old to remain at the Lutheran Home in Kew.</p>
<p>In 1973, the Church proposed the closure of the Home in Kew and the acquisition of new properties for 'cottage homes'. By 1976 four new cottage homes were opened in Dryden Street, Doncaster East, Heatherdale Road, Mitcham, Mountfield Road, Nunawading and Dobell Street, Blackburn South. Each cottage home cared for five or six children, and while they were specifically designed, they looked like any other modern suburban home. The children were placed in these homes so that brothers and sisters were kept together.</p>
<p> In 1980 the Teenage Care Home at 755 Station Street, Box Hill was closed and converted to become an administrative and welfare centre for Lutheran Social Services.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, it was decided to shift the Lutheran Church's resources to the area of Glenelg in south-west Victoria. This move occurred between 1983 and 1988 when the last remaining cottage in Melbourne closed. This led to the creation of Glenelg Foster Care in 1983 and the opening of Family Group Homes in 1984 in Warrnambool, in Portland in 1985 and in Hamilton in 1989.</p>
<p>Glenelg Foster Care amalgamated with other agencies in the district to form South Western Community Care Association Inc. in 1991. This became known as Community Connections (Victoria) in 1998.</p>
<p>In 1989 in response to a demonstrated need to provide services for homeless young people, Lutheran Children's Homes agreed to auspice the Ringwood Extended Family Services program. It was devised to meet the needs of young people between the ages of 12 and 18 through the use of mediation and conflict resolution for young people and their families. It provided short-term substitute and longer term student accommodation. This program extended to Hamilton in 1995.</p>
