<biogHist>
<abstract>The Allambie Reception Centre opened in Burwood in 1961, on the former site of Kildonan Children's Home. It was the Victorian Government's main reception centre for children. Allambie could accommodate up to 90 children including (from 1964) babies and toddlers and by the 1970s its capacity had grown to 228 children. Allambie closed in 1990.</abstract>
<p>Allambie, a government-run reception centre for Victorian children, opened in Burwood in 1961, on the former site of Kildonan Children's Home.</p>
<p>Allambie became the Department's main 'reception, treatment, classification and transit centre'. It was established to alleviate overcrowding at Turana, Royal Park.</p>
<p>Children who were State Wards also came to Allambie following a breakdown in home release, foster care or a children's home placement.</p>
<p>When it opened, Allambie could accommodate up to 90 children in four separate sections. Until the nursery opened at Allambie in 1964, it did not receive babies and toddlers (who were accommodated in the old nursery at Turana).</p>
<p>The Education Department operated a school in the grounds of Allambie although some children attended schools in the community.</p>
<p>A child's placement was decided upon by the Placement Committee, which met once a week. In 1962, the Committee comprised representatives of the Department (including the Director of Family Welfare) and Allambie staff (including the Superintendent and Assistant Superintendent, and Medical Officer).</p>
<p>According to Jenkinson, in the 1970s, Allambie consisted of three large sections: Waratah, Kurrajong and Mimosa: these accommodated groups of mixed age and sex which enabled sibling groups to be placed together. At Allambie, the Nursery section accommodated babies. 'Tecoma' accommodated up to 10 school-age boys and 'Heath/Cassia' accommodated 22 adolescent girls.</p>
<p>However, it would seem that siblings were not always kept together at Allambie. One former resident, who was at Allambie in 1974, made contact with the Find &amp; Connect web resource to point out that she was separated from her younger brother.</p>
<p>'I would like to say that it is not correct at my time in Allambie in 1974 that siblings were accommodated together. There may have been three sections, l can't remember if there was or not but l do remember how upset l was that l could not see my younger brother. I was 6/7 and my brother was 4 and l clearly remember trying to see him in the play area for younger children, an area l was not allowed in because l was too old. I also remember the staff having no understanding of how upset l was about this when l got caught in the playground because it was the only way l could see him. l was not there for very long, l remember the school there and that it was very overcrowded, so much so that children slept on mattresses on the floor.'</p>
<p>Another former Allambie resident recalled sneaking out at night so that she could see her two younger brothers. In a comment on a post in the <span style="font-style:italic">Inside</span> blog, she wrote, "When we did get to play together we were on leads all the time … I hated that place."</p>
<p>Overcrowding was a major problem at Allambie in the 1970s. A letter to the <span style="font-style:italic">Age</span> in December 1970 mentioned "the sorry conditions at Allambie":</p>
<p>'Though Allambie is called a reception centre only, it is fast becoming a permanent holding place for children, though not planned or geared to that role. The staff has to cope not only with numbers beyond their abilities and facilities, but with many children - eg the mentally retarded and emotionally disturbed - who should be having special care for their individual problems.'</p>
<p>In 1972, Allambie had a capacity of 228 children, but this was often exceeded. By the mid 1970s the number of children placed at Allambie reached an all-time high. On several occasions, over 300 children were in residence.</p>
<p>Overcrowding decreased as alternative reception and care programs were implemented by the Department. During the 1970s, changes in the structure of state-run facilities, including regionalisation of services, reduced the need for large-scale centralised reception centre like Allambie.</p>
<p>By the early 1980s, Allambie accommodated about 100 children. A review in 1985 recommended the closure of Allambie, and the redirection of funding to regional reception centres. The nursery at Allambie closed in 1986. Allambie Reception Centre closed in June 1990.</p>
