<h5>Berry Street Admission of Children &amp; Claims for Child Endowment &amp; Family Allowance 1973-1981</h5>
<p>There are limited copies of records that were sent to the Commonwealth Department of Social Services in the 1970s when a child was admitted to or discharged from Berry Street's care. The admission forms provide the "full name and address of person or authority last receiving endowment for the above child (i.e. Parent, Guardian or Institution") and the discharge forms say "Full name of person or institution to whom child was discharged". These records are incomplete and while there are records up to 1981 in the collection, most of them are from 1973-1974.</p>

<h5>Photographs and Scrapbooks</h5>
<list><item>Grey album - Beaconsfield Babies' Home, 1922-1937 (Most photos from 1922-1923, less than ten photos from c.1937)<br />
The photos in this album depict children and nurses at Berry Street's Beaconsfield property. Common scenes include nurses holding babies, toddlers eating at tables, and scenes from around the Beaconsfield property. Some photos include captions. The album includes a typed index containing the names of children, where available, and estimated dates. This album was likely put together by a Berry Street Mothercraft nurse.</item>
<item>Black scrapbook - Berry Street, 1929-1960<br />
The scrapbook includes newspaper clippings about Berry Street (and its predecessor agencies) and photographs.

<h5>Finding Aids</h5>
