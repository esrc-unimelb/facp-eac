<biogHist>
<abstract>Glastonbury Community Services Records date from 1853 to 2015 and relate to the operation of Glastonbury Community Services and its predecessor agencies. The records are held by Barwon Child, Youth &amp; Family. The collection includes the records of over 2,000 children that were in its 'care'. The collection includes admission records, roll books, matron and superintendent reports, financial records, videos and photographs.</abstract>
<h4> Access Conditions</h4>
<p>Conditional Access - Former residents of Glastonbury's out-of-home care programs and their families can contact Barwon Child, Youth &amp; Family to gain access to records and information about their time in 'care'. Access is restricted due to the fragility and confidentiality of the records. An application form will need to be completed and proof of identity provided.</p>
<p>Barwon Child, Youth &amp; Family, Archive Search Information for Past Clients, 2015, states:</p>
<p>'Barwon Child, Youth &amp; Family is unable to guarantee to have information about all past orphanage clients. Record keeping in times gone by was often scant and some past clients many only have an entry in the<br />
admissions books.</p>
<p>If we do have records about you or a member of your family we will process your request as quickly as possible.'</p>
