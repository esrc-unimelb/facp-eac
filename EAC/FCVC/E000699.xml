<biogHist>
<abstract>The Kildonan UnitingCare Records collection dates from 1881 to 2001. The records relate to the operation of Kildonan UnitingCare and its predecessor agencies. The collection includes client files, admission records, photographs and publications.</abstract>
<h4>Access Conditions</h4>
<p>The Uniting Heritage Service supports past residents of Kildonan looking for records or information about their time in care. If you were a past resident or client of Kildonan or any of the orphanages, homes and other residences run by its predecessor organisations, there may be information and history about you held there. Limited records are available before the 1960s but more detailed information is available from then on.</p>
<h4>Records</h4>
<p>The collection includes a complete set of individual files and records relating to Kildonan residents dating back to 1881, and these are well documented. For example, it includes the admission and after care books details of those children taken into care from 1881. Individual paper files were produced from 1912, and these have been catalogued and filed. A separate card index was also in use from 1951 - 1983 recording the details of those children in care. From the 1960s, there are large individual file records and day book entries. The collection contains some memorabilia and Committee minutes and records dating from 1918 - 1964, and a selection of Annual Reports.</p>
<p>The collection includes a large collection of photographs dating from approximately 1940 - 2000. In 2013 Kildonan UnitingCare received a Commonwealth Government Grant which enabled it to describe its photographic and slide collection that were commissioned for fundraising and promotional activities, and identify as many children and workers as possible with the help of past residents. The focus is on photos of children in care from 1940 - 1980, and, on making those photos available to past residents.</p>

<h4>Dhurringile Rural Training Farm</h4>
<p>This collection of records contains some items about Dhurringile Rural Training Farm (i.e. Admission registers with names, and committee meeting minutes that refer to Dhurringile). Please note that this collection does not contain the Client Files, Dhurringile Training Farm (1948? - 1964?).</p>
<h4>Adoption Records</h4>
<p>Any records relating to adoptions arranged by Kildonan's predecessor organisations are released through the Adoption Information Service, Connections Uniting Care.

<h4>Records held in other repositories</h4>
<p>There are some copies of Annual Reports and other general reports at the following archives:<br />
1. Scots Church - older Annual Reports, newsletters etc. from 1881 to 1977<br />
2. Presbyterian Archive - Annual Reports, newsletters etc. from 1881 to 1977<br />
3. UnitingCare and Uniting Church Archives - from 1977 to present day Annual Reports, newsletters etc.</p>
<h4>Archival Services</h4>
<p>Kildonan has established a Heritage Program which is currently staffed one day per week by a paid member of staff. Part of the program also includes volunteers who are able to assist with file and committee minute records searches.<br />
Early records up until 1960 generally contain a card file and correspondence between the Home and parents. When staff resources are available, an additional search is made for personal information which may be contained in the Home Committee minutes. When located, such information is transcribed and vetted according to protect the private details of individuals.</p>
