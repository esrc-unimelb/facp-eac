<biogHist>
<abstract>The Seaside Home at Frankston was established in 1901. It was originally intended to be a holiday home for the boys from Melbourne Ragged Boys' Home but from 1904 boys were placed permanently in Frankston. In 1924, Seaside Home, Frankston became Minton Boys' Home.</abstract>
<p>In 1901, William Minton the superintendent of Melbourne Ragged Boys' Home, made the decision to rent 'Pine Hill', on Olivers Hill, Frankston from a Mr Wells for 8/ - per week under a three year lease. Minton named it Seaside Home and the decision was made that some of the boys from the Boys' Home could visit on weekends and in school holidays.</p>
<p>'Pine Hill' house was bought for &amp;pound;250 in 1904 and by October of that year eighteen boys were permanently living there with Mrs Bolger as Matron. This was a successful venture with lots of support from local people and businesses and another twenty boys were transferred in 1905 from the Melbourne Ragged Boys' Home.</p>
<p>More boys continued to be transferred to the Seaside Home and in 1913 a new wing was added to accommodate the growing numbers.</p>
<p>In 1922 the house "Holcombe' and five acres of land adjoining the Home at Frankston were purchased. At this time seventy boys attended the Seaside Home. School No.4136 was established in a room within Holcombe with the State providing a teacher and supplies. A large vegetable garden was also established within the grounds for the boys to work on.</p>
<p>On 14 October 1924 Seaside Home, Frankston became Minton Boys Home in recognition of the work of the Honorary Superintendent William Minton and his wife Mabel who had been the Matron.</p>
